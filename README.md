# DigitRecognitionAutoencoder
Training and testing a basic 3-layer autoencoder to recognize numerical digits using publicly available MNIST dataset.

Scripts include the following: 
`1) Evaluating model with varied number of hidden units on predicting the digit 3
`2) Visualizing the weights converging to each of the hidden units for a model with 10 and 20 units in its hidden layer
